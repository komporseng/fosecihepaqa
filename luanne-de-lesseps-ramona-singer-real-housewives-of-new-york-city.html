All of that is changing though with Singer's recent social media post. Singer has <a href=#>been accused of being racist </a>and to celebrate the New Year, she took to sharing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an image on Instagram </a>that reinforces that idea.<strong> Maybe posting an image standing in front of a stereotypical (and racist) depiction of an Indigenous unnamed man for your holiday post isn't exactly the best move.</strong> De Lesseps rightfully called Singer out for this in her post.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Singer, who has comments limited on her post, is standing in front of a fireplace with a Christmas tree and the portrait that some users are claiming is a portrait of <strong>Sitting Bull</strong>, a <strong>Hunkpapa Lakota</strong> leader. Because she has the comments limited, all anyone can currently see are people agreeing with positive comments. But de Lesseps is pushing back at Singer for the post given her recent controversy in the news.<strong><a href=#> Luann De Lesseps</a> isn't perfect, she did <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">famously dress like </a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Diana Ross</a> on the show and offended fans by doing so.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/the-real-housewives-of-new-york-city-tv-show-poster.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>The Real Housewives of New York City</h5>TV-14Reality TV<p class=display-card-description></p><p data-testid=plot>A fast-paced reality show that follows several incredibly busy and ambitious Manhattan women.

She reportedly said the N-word to a crew member but what confirmed it and got her kicked out of BravoCon was Singer denying that she used the N-word by writing an abbreviated version of it in a text exchange with a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>PageSix </strong>reporter</a>.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/is-sai-from-the-real-housewives-of-new-york-city-a-husband-stealer.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Sai From 'The Real Housewives of New York City' May Be a Husband Stealer">Sai From 'The Real Housewives of New York City' May Be a Husband Stealer</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>A social media post implies the 'RHONY' cast member had an affair with her now-husband while he was married to someone else.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Singer standing in front of a painting of an Indigenous man that could be a depiction of Sitting Bull is not the problem.
