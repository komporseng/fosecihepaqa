There are many aspects of Impossible Mode that will sound extremely appealing to players, especially those who edge more on the completionist side of the gaming sphere. This article will take you through everything you need to know about the mode and how to unlock Impossible Mode in <a href=#>Dead Space Remake</a>.</p><p>Recommended Videos</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Unlocking Impossible Mode in Dead Space Remake</h2><p data-characters=336 data-current-count=336 data-injectable=false>In order to unlock Impossible Mode in Dead Space Remake you will simply have to <strong>complete the game on any difficulty level that you wish</strong>. There is no need for you to choose a higher difficulty level on your first playthrough of the game. However, unlike the 1999 mode from BioShock Infinite, there is no secret code to unlock it quickly.</p><p data-characters=185 data-current-count=521 data-injectable=true>This means that you will have to just play the game leisurely and enjoy everything that it offers you along the way. You will have the Impossible Mode unlocked quicker than you realize.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>All Changes With Impossible Mode in the Remake of Dead Space</h3><p data-characters=394 data-current-count=394 data-injectable=false>This is a brutal difficulty setting which will push the limits of everything you’ve previously known in the experience. The original Dead Space had this difficulty setting and there aren’t too many changes apart from there only being <strong>one save file you will have access to</strong>. You need to also make sure to save at whatever save stations you can find as there isn’t any autosave.</p><p data-characters=499 data-current-count=893 data-injectable=true>All of the other changes with the mode are the same compared to the original. Some of these are that you will deal less damage than before but take higher damage from enemies. Generally, a lot of the main changes carry over from Hard difficulty mode such as the aforementioned damage increase from enemies. The item resources will notably be much lower as they will drop less. Whether you are <a href=#>playing the game on a Steam Deck</a> or not you will have to be extra careful of everything in the game world.</p><p data-characters=94 data-current-count=94 data-injectable=false><strong>Dead Space Remake</strong> is available at this very moment for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p><i data-stringify-type=italic>Attack of the Fanboy is supported by our audience.
