Learn about their relationship, the school she is attending, her age, and her hometown.</p><p>Keep scrolling down to learn more about Ava Viegelahn.</p><h3><strong>Meet Ava Viegelahn, The Voice Star Brayden Lape Girlfriend</strong></h3><p>The Voice is closing toward the end and one of the contestants to make it to the Top 8 is Brayden Lape. Brayden has been receiving support from everyone from his hometown of Michigan. His family has been very excited about his journey so far. On the way, he has also gained a lot of followers and admirers who are willing to learn if he is single.</p><p>But, to your dismay, we’d like to announce that Brayden is taken. He is in a relationship with his girlfriend Ava Viegelahn. Brayden’s “No.1 Fan,” Ava is over the moon for her boyfriend’s newfound success and fame. Although in late July 2022, Brayden claimed jokingly that he was single, that surely isn’t the case.</p><p>Ava and Brayden went Instagram official seven months before in January 2022. Their family and friends commented “Cuties,” “The most gorgeous couple oml,” and “So cute! Best coupleeeeeee,” among other things. They have featured each other on their respective socials multiple times.</p><p>The only thing that we can say is that the young couple is deeply in love with each other.</p><p>Brayden performed “This Town” by Nial Horgan at The Voice auditions, but only one chair turned. But judge Blake Shelton’s chair turn was the one he needed the most. After that, he performed “Pretty Heart” by Parker McCollum for the battle round, “Mercey” by Brett Young for the knockout rounds, “Buy Dirt” by Jordan Davis and Luke Bryan for the top-16, “Come Over” by Kenny Chesney for the top-10, and “Homesick” by Kane Brown for the top-8.</p><p>According to the singer, “Homesick” was the perfect song choice for him that week. “This is a song I can kind of relate to, being out here all this time and missing home. This is a perfect song because I’m definitely missing my friends. Missing my family. I’m 16 and this is like, the longest I’ve been away from home,” he said at the time.</p><p>And the judges wholeheartedly concur. Coach Gwen Stefani remarked, “That chorus fit you like a glove.” “It is actually watching you blossom vocally and aesthetically in front of our eyes,” Blake continued. Brayden would likely grow to be way too huge, according to the judge, for them to ever be invited back to the show.</p><p>On The Voice, Brayden’s fellow competitors Parijita Bastola (Team Legend), Rowan Grace, Justin Aaron, Kim Cruse (Team Legend), Bryce Leatherwood, Kique (Team Gwen), Morgan Myles (Team Camila), Bodie, and Omar Jose Cardona all made it to the top 10. (Team Legend).</p><h3><strong>Ava Viegelahn Age</strong></h3><p>In 2022, Ava Viegelahn is currently 17 years old.</p><h3><strong>Ava Viegelahn High School</strong></h3><p>Ava Viegelah is currently attending Grass Lake High School where she is attending 11th grade in 2022.
