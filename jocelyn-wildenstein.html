The seventy-five-year-old has earned the moniker ‘Catwoman’ and’The Lion Queen.’</p><p>In her mid-seventies, Jocelyn leads a lavish lifestyle, complete with a plethora of spotlights. Alec N. Wildenstein, a fellow millionaire, was her husband. From 1978 through 1999, the couple was married for twenty-two years.</p><p>Wildenstein has amassed a net worth of <strong>$10 million</strong> as of 2021, according to celebrity net worth. While the sum may appear large to the socialite, it is insignificant when compared to her previous worth as a billionaire. Alec, her ex-husband, has a net worth of <strong>$10 billion</strong> as of 2021.</p><p>Jocelyn Wildenstein, a former billionaire, knows how to live like one by living a lavish lifestyle and spending a large portion of her income on her comfort. When her yearly phone bill and wine prices were computed at roughly <strong>$547, 000</strong>, she gained a lot of notoriety. In addition, her divorce deal with Alec netted her a stunning <strong>$2.5 billion</strong>.</p><p>Wildenstein underwent a series of plastic surgery procedures on her face, resulting in a radically different appearance. She squandered a large portion of her fortune on many plastic procedures. The Catwoman even sold her previous New York home for a whopping $13 million to real estate entrepreneur Janna Bullock.</p><p>Her love connections, aside from her cosmetic changes, are also fascinating. Wildstein hasn’t been married, but she has had the experience of being a wife.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/YouTube-300x300.jpeg><h2>Relationship status of Jocelyn Wildenstein:</h2><p>Jocelyn Wildenstein has been involved in a number of well-known romances in the past. She dated Swiss Cyril Piguet, a producer of several top films, including ‘Un Commerce tranquille,’ before marrying Alec N Wildenstein. At the time, the diva was just seventeen years old.</p><p>For a long time, Jocelyn and Piguet’s love was doomed. Sergio Gobbi, an Italian-French filmmaker, was in another relationship with the plastic surgery star. Sergio spent a lot of time with her in Paris. It was in that fantasy metropolis that she honed her hunting and piloting skills. Wildenstein was married to Lloyd Klein, a French couturier, for over a decade after her divorce, from 2003 until 2016.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Glamour-Fame-1-300x300.jpeg><h2>Divorcee To Alec N Wildenstein:</h2><p>Jocelyn Wildenstein, an American socialite, is a former millionaire, thanks in part to her ex-husband Alec N. Wildenstein. Alec comes from a long line of art dealers, which explains why he has a net worth of $10 billion.</p><p>Wildenstein married businessman Alec Wildenstein in 1978 after courting for several years. When the lovebirds exchanged vows, they were both in their forties. The couple had been married for twenty-two years. In the midst of it all, they brought two gorgeous children into their lives.</p><p>Despite spending over two decades together, Jocelyn Wildenstein and Alec N Wildenstein’s relationship ended badly. When the Cat Woman discovered her husband sleeping with a 19-year-old Russian model, the couple separated in 1999. The art dealer became so enraged that he threatened Jocelyn with a gun, putting the diva in a strong negotiating position in their divorce settlement.</p><h2>Jocelyn Wildenstein’s Early Life:</h2><p>Jocelyn Wildenstein was born in Lausanne, Switzerland, on September 7, 1945. At the age of 17, she began dating film producers and directors. She then relocated to Paris, where she honed her skills as a hunter and pilot.</p><p>When it comes to the Wildenstein family, there is no formal information available. She prefers to keep her personal life secret.
