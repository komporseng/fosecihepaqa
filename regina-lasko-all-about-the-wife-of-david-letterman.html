In 2009, David admitted that he had relationships with multiple ladies who served in his program Late Show with David Letterman. The artist had even slept with the assistant, who was often featured in the program. Her name is Stephanie Birkitt. He also blames himself for the deeds he has taken.&nbsp;David even claims that if there is a flowchart for this situation or sex scandal, his name would be at the top. David has no choice but to accept responsibility for it.</p><h2>Regina married David in a civil ceremony</h2><p>David was in a romantic connection with Merrill Markoe, a novelist, while his relationship began with Regina.&nbsp;Nonetheless, Merrill and David parted ways, leaving David and Regina alone. Everyone around them assumed the couple would never marry after dating for more than two decades.&nbsp;On November 3, 2003, they became parents. Harry Joseph Letterman is the name of their kid.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Regina-Lasko-2.jpg alt="Regina Lasko" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>They finally chose to marry on March 19, 2009. Their wedding took place in a private courtroom civil ceremony in Choteau, Montana.&nbsp;Pete Howard, commonly known as the Justice of the Peace, presided over the ceremony. In his program, the artist also revealed their wedding plans and explained why they waited so long to make the choice.</p><h2>Regina’s child was abducted</h2><p>Their only son was almost taken, which was unfortunate but true. To clarify the problem, Regina’s husband hired a painter in 2005 to paint the home.&nbsp;The individual who was hired plotted and attempted to abduct Harry and his nanny for a total of $5 million.&nbsp;At the time, Harry Joseph Letterman was only 16 months old. Kelly Allen Frank was the name of the kidnapper.</p><p>He devised a comprehensive strategy, but he was apprehended and sentenced to 10 years in jail. Nonetheless, he escaped from prison in 2007, only to be apprehended again. He was released on parole in 2014.</p><h2>His first wife’s divorce</h2><p>Michelle Cook was David’s first wife. The woman is claimed to have been David’s girlfriend since college.&nbsp;However, the couple chose to marry in 1968. Michelle was the one who recommended David go to Los Angeles and pursue a career in the entertainment industry.&nbsp;The woman was with David when he started his career in comedy. They had been married for over a decade before deciding to split in 1977.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Regina-Lasko-3.jpg alt="Regina Lasko" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>David Letterman facts you may not have known</h2><p>Aside from his personal life, he has additional characteristics. David had worked as a supermarket bagger in Indianapolis before or through high school.&nbsp;Aside from that, he is the longest-running late-night TV host.&nbsp;Nonetheless, his favorite band, the Foo Fighters, performed for his farewell broadcast on the program. David was also never seen wearing the same tie on his program again.&nbsp;Finally, the pencil he used on the show had erasers on both ends, so even if he flung it towards the crowd, no one was hurt.</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>Regina Lasko’s net worth is believed to be $90 million as of December 2023.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGipnp%2BZo65uuMCsoqhlkaG5bq3BqKytZaSdsm7DyJ%2BcZqeWYrGiwsidZKWdpKmys7nAp2Y%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
