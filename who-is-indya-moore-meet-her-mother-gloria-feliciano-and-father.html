Meet Her Mother Gloria Feliciano And Father</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-06-15</div><p>I<strong>ndya Moore’s parents are unknown</strong>. American actress Indya Adrianna Moore has established herself as one of the most important people. Indya Adrianna Moore, an American actress and model, is also known as Indya Moore. Her birthday is January 17, 1995.&nbsp;Moore identifies as transgender and non-binary and uses the pronouns they/them and she/her. They rose to prominence after portraying Angel Evangelista in the FX television series Pose. Moore got worldwide attention in 2019 when Time magazine named him one of the world’s 100 most important people.</p><p>Their campaign for gender diversity and representation has had far-reaching consequences in the entertainment industry and beyond.</p><h2>Who is Indya Moore’s mother?</h2><p>Indya Moore’s parents are secret and unknown to the general world. The motivating figure seems to be a private person, since they have not divulged much about their personal lives. We may deduce from the few information provided that Indya Moore’s mother’s name is Gloria Feliciano.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Indya-Moore-1.jpg alt="Indya Moore" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She is characterized as a Puerto Rican lady from the Bronx. According to an article on Indya and their mother, the mother and kid have a good bond and often do activities together, including travel. According to the essay, Feliciano had trouble comprehending Indya’s desire to wear her pants when they were younger.&nbsp;However, as she has matured and learned new things, she has developed a closer bond with her daughter.&nbsp;Aside from that, little information about her mother, Gloria Feliciano, is accessible to the media or fans. Hopefully, we will learn more about this lovely mother and daughter and their connection in the near future.</p><h2>Indya Moore’s Father</h2><p>As previously said, the attractive beauty has kept all details about her parents and family private. The media and her fans are unaware of Indya Moore’s father’s location.&nbsp;However, based on the little facts available, we may deduce that Indya Moore’s father is a Dominican Republic-born Catholic.</p><p>Despite the fact that nothing is known about him, it is reasonable to conclude that he contributed to Indya’s ethnic history. No sources, however, give any precise information about their father’s childhood, relationship with Indya, or any other element of his life.</p><h2>Indya Moore Early Years</h2><p>As a kid, Indya Moore, a Bronx native and person of mixed heritage, had to face tremendous challenges.&nbsp;They were born designated male and faced transphobia from their parents, prompting them to leave home at 14 and enter foster care.&nbsp;They lived in all five boroughs of New York City during the time, travelling about a lot.&nbsp;Unfortunately, they were regularly tormented, which led to their choice to drop out of high school after their sophomore year.&nbsp;Moore, on the other hand, began modeling at the age of 15 and went on to work for well-known fashion firms such as Dior and Gucci. Despite their modeling success, they were dissatisfied with the industry’s focus on body appearance.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Indya-Moore-2.jpg alt="Indya Moore" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Their lives changed when they met ballroom dancer Jose Gutierez Xtravaganza, who encouraged them to pursue acting.&nbsp;Moore amazed the judges and shown their skill when they travelled to the Tribeca Film Festival to try out for the indie film Saturday Church.&nbsp;Moore, in addition to acting, has appeared at New York Fashion Week, cooperated with Katy Perry on the “Swish Swish” music video, and even performed on Saturday Night Live as a member of the House of Xtravaganza.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddnsButc2dsJplnaS8s7GMppyerF2dsrN5zKiroZ2iYrStu9GimGaelaG2pLXAp6ZmmZ6Zeqet06Gcq2c%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
