Those who believe her say that Putin has cast this truth under the rug in order to avoid being seen as “an illegitimate child who had grown up in Georgia,” which has historically been a thorn in Russia’s side.</p></span><span class=credit>Laski Diffusion</span><h2 class=title>He Was A Bully As A Child</h2><img alt="Bully Corbis" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/bully-corbis.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body>Putin biographer Masha Gessen alleges that growing up in a battered, post-siege environment such as St. Petersburg made Putin a bully.<p>In The Man Without a Face: The Unlikely Rise of Vladimir Putin, one of Putin’s childhood friends recalls that they grew up in “a mean, hungry, impoverished place that bred mean, hungry, ferocious children.”</p></span><span class=credit>EPA/Corbis</span><h2 class=title>According to Putin, Sports Saved His Life</h2><img alt="Putin Judo" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/putin-judo.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body>Putin took up judo and sambo in 1965. He developed an intense dedication to the martial arts, as he said it encourages training in both physical and mental strength. “Judo is not just a sport,” he later said. “It’s a philosophy. It’s respect for your elders and for your opponent. It’s not for weaklings.”<p>Putin would go on to travel around the country as a judo champion, and later remarked that “If I hadn’t taken up sport, who knows what would have happened. It was sport that took me off the street.”</p></span><span class=credit>ALEXEY DRUZHININ/AFP/Getty Images</span><h2 class=title>His Parents Nearly Died In The Siege Of Leningrad</h2><img alt="Putin Parents Kremlin" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/putin-parents-kremlin.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body>When the Germans invaded Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) in 1944, over a million people died. Putin’s parents nearly added to that body count. While his father survived, a battle left him severely disfigured and disabled.

Putin, then 25 and already working for the KGB for two years at the time, took the smaller room — the first time he ever had a room of his own.</p></span><span class=credit>Imgur</span><h2 class=title>Spy Thrillers Helped Shape Putin’s Approach To Politics</h2><img alt="Spy Thrillers Wikipedia" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/spy-thrillers-wikipedia.jpg> <span class=caption-body>According to Richard Sakwa, author of Putin: Russia’s Choice, spy thrillers influenced Putin’s politics and professional aspirations.<p>As Putin would later say, films and TV shows such as Sword and Shield and Seventeen Moments of Spring underscored the idea that “one man’s effort could achieve what whole armies could not.”</p><p>Sakwa goes on to say that these thrillers’ themes — patriotic but not overly ideological — mirror Putin’s own approach to politics:</p><p>“The struggle was to defend the Soviet motherland against its various enemies, not to defend the communist regime against its ideological opponents. This relatively non-ideological patriotism shaped Putin’s personality and later took him into a career with the KGB.”</p></span><span class=credit>YouTube</span><h2 class=title>Putin Says He’s Not A Diplomat — But Does A Scary Good Job On Studying Those With Whom He Meets</h2><img alt="Putin Diplomat Wikimedia" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/putin-diplomat-wikimedia.jpg> <span class=caption-body>When a reporter inquired as to whether Putin considered himself a diplomat, he responded with a resounding “no.”<p>That’s not to say that Putin doesn’t engage in the often mind-numbing diplomatic ritual of reading up on any and every person with whom he may interact, however.</p><p>In his memoirs, former U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott recalls an instance where he met with Putin, who proceeded to reference the names of the poets that Talbott had studied decades ago at Yale and Oxford. Talbott later called this an “unnerving but impressive” experience, and one which made clear that Putin listens with “an attentiveness that seemed at least as calculating as it is courteous.”</p></span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>No One Knows Much About His Daughters — Besides The Fact That They Are Obscenely Wealthy</h2><img alt="Putin Daughters" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/putin-daughters.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Putin has intentionally kept his daughters, Katerina and Maria, out of the limelight. A recent Reuters investigation has revealed one item about them, however: They’re loaded.<p>Katerina’s spouse is the son of a banker close to Putin, and together the couple have corporate holdings worth around $2 billion. Outside of that, they own a $3.7 million seaside villa in France, which they acquired from a family friend.</p><p>Putin, however, claims a slightly humbler existence: In 2015, he reported a 2014 income of $119,000 and listed owning two modest apartments, Reuters reported. Other sources dispute such modesty, and allege that he has a personal fortune of $200 billion.</p></span><span class=credit>YouTube</span><h2 class=title>He Has Been Linked To The Murders Of His Critics</h2><img alt=Litvinenko style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/litvinenko.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Putin has amassed an array of critics throughout his time in power — and many of them have died under mysterious circumstances, circumstances which some attribute to Putin.<p>In 2006, journalist and highly-vocal Putin critic Alexander Litvinenko died after being poisoned with polonium-210. A 2016 official inquiry into the matter showed that the agents who poisoned Litvinenko were acting on orders that were “probably approved by President Putin.”</p><p>Another journalist, Anna Politkovskaya, accused Putin of turning Russia into a police state in her book Putin’s Russia. On October 7, 2006, Vladimir Putin’s 54th birthday, contract workers shot Politkovskaja dead outside her home. Her murder — coupled with the date on which it took place — prompted many to look to Putin when attempting to explain who was behind it.</p><p>Pictured: Women holding a poster of deceased former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko.</p></span><span class=credit>Alexey SAZONOV/AFP/Getty Images</span><h2 class=title>His “Bromance” With Donald Trump Goes Back To 2007 — And Is Largely One-Sided</h2><img alt="Putn Trump" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/putn-trump.jpg> <span class=caption-body>While Donald Trump has been quick to highlight the fact that Vladimir Putin admires the President-elect, their so-called bromance began with Trump’s courtship of Putin.<p>In October 2007, several months after Russia was accused of conducting cyber warfare against Estonia, Trump offered TV host Larry King positive remarks on Putin. “Look at Putin — what he’s doing with Russia — I mean, you know, what’s going on over there. I mean this guy has done — whether you like him or don’t like him — he’s doing a great job in rebuilding the image of Russia and also rebuilding Russia period.”</p></span><span class=credit>PETRAS MALUKAS/AFP/Getty Images</span><h2 class=title>He Has Amassed An Array Of Republican Presidential Fans</h2><img alt="Putin Bush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/putin-bush.jpg> <span class=caption-body>In 2001 — years before Donald Trump would lionize Putin for his so-called greatness — George W. Bush publicly fawned over his first encounter with Putin, which took place during the Slovenia Summit.<p>"I looked the man in the eye,” Bush recounted during a later press conference. “I found him to be very straightforward and trustworthy. We had a very good dialogue. I was able to get a sense of his soul; a man deeply committed to his country and the best interests of his country."</p><p>Then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice would go on to rue Bush’s words, writing in her memoir No Higher Honor that "We were never able to escape the perception that the president had naïvely trusted Putin and then been betrayed."</p></span><span class=credit>OMAR TORRES/AFP/Getty Images</span><h2 class=title>He Ruined A Ukrainian National Treasure To Make A Political Point</h2><img alt=Drinking style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/drinking.jpg> <span class=caption-body>After Putin successfully annexed Crimea — a long-held aspiration of his — he celebrated accordingly. The Russian autocrat called former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and invited him to split a bottle of wine. This wasn’t just any wine, however: This was a 240-year-old bottle of wine that Ukraine considered to be a national treasure.<p>The duo downed a 1775 bottle of Jeres de la Frontera, which Count Mikhail Vorontsov brought to the region during the reign of Catherine the Great. The former prosecutor general of Crimea proceeded to file a lawsuit against Putin for more than $100,000 in damages.</p></span><span class=credit>DAVID GOLDMAN/AFP/Getty Images</span><h2 class=title>He’s Developed A Cult Of Personality Unseen Since Joseph Stalin</h2><img alt="Putin Shirt" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/putin-shirt.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Given his vow to restore Russia to the global seat of power and traditional values, it should not come as much of a surprise that Putin has become a hot commodity among Russians.<p>Indeed, in Russia you can find Putin-inspired cologne; Putin iPhone cases, and Putin t-shirts. Perhaps the most dramatic item of them all is a 400-page book called Words That Change the World. The tome is filled with Putin quotes, and the Kremlin sends it to members of the Federal Assembly every new year.</p></span><span class=credit>OLGA MALTSEVA/AFP/Getty Images</span><h2 class=title>One Of His Biggest Heroes Is A Mystic Poet</h2><img alt="Vladimir Solovyov Wikimedia" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Vladimir-Solovyov-wikimedia.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Putin has stated that one of his greatest philosophical heroes is Vladimir Solovyov, a 19th century poet and philosopher.<p>And according to Solovyov’s biographer, Judith Deutsch Kornblatt, it’s not surprising.

This isn’t an isolated incident. Putin has arrived hours late for meetings with John Kerry and Queen Elizabeth II, and even arrived late to the scene of a plane crash that killed children.
