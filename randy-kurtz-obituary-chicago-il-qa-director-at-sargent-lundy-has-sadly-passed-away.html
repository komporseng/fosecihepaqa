Kurtz, who resided in Lorain and was 54 years old at the time of his passing, was called home to be with the Lord on Monday, March 15, 2021, while he was sleeping peacefully in his home. Despite having been born in Lorain on January 11, 1967, Randy spent his childhood in Amherst, where he attended Marion L. Steele High School and ultimately graduated.</p><p>Lorain was his home for the majority of his life, and he never left. Over the course of 36 years, Randy was employed at Invacare as a welder. Fishing, hunting turkeys, cooking, and spending time with friends and family, as well as assisting them with projects, were some of his favorite activities. When he listened to his favorite songs on the radio,</p><p>he enjoyed singing along with them. He found great pleasure in the company of his pets, in addition to his family. Surviving members of his family include his wife of 32 years, Lisa Ann Kurtz (nee: Fleming); his children, Katelynn Kurtz of Lorain and Kyle Kurtz (Rachel) of Norwalk; his grandchildren,</p><p>Jayce, Annalynn, Remi, Kyersen, and Rymer; his siblings, Robert Kurtz, Adam Woodcock, Rick Kurtz, Scott Strunk, and Christina Kurtz Scanlon; and his step father, George Woodcock of South Amherst, and his step mother, Rita Kurtz of Kentucky. It was his father, William Kurtz, and his mother, Rebecca Woodcock (née Malin), as well as his brother, Richard Kurtz, who passed away before him.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwvsCnm7Jlm6q%2FtcaMqJmirKWWv7p5wqGgnJmXpHqquIyqmGacmaeypMDOq2SarF2orrOzxKerZqSlo7G6eceaqmarkZm5unnPmqqsnZRirrit2Gg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
