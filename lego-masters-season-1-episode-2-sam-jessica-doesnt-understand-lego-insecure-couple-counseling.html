It clearly brings out the anxious and sometimes snarky side of people. In the second episode of Fox's 'Lego Masters', the contestants are expected to make a space-themed build, which will be smashed by the judges. It's a stressful time and the contestants sniping at each other doesn't help.</p><p>Teammates Sam Hatmaker and Jessica Ragzy Ewud, who were already on edge in the previous episode, are close to coming to blows in this one. Sam continues to snap at Jessica and actually told her that she doesn't get Lego.</p><p>Fans are getting rather irritated with him and have flooded social media with their reactions. A fan wrote, "The hipster with the flower in his hair is stressing. Me. Out."</p><p>"Is Sam’s bow a little too tight? Because he’s being a giant ass again this week," tweeted another.</p><p>"Dear Sam and Jessica, Two words: Couples Therapy. Love, The Viewers," wrote a fan.&nbsp;"The dude with the beard and the barrette seriously needs to chill out," another said.</p><p>Host Will Arnett had to actually counsel them.&nbsp;A viewer wrote, "Sam if you don’t shut the f**k up. You’d have a lot more done if you stop running your mouth."</p><p>Though Sam and Jessica are not a couple, many fans believe that they are, and call him "cold-hearted".&nbsp;Some fans are reeling over his thinly-veiled insults. "#WednesdayThoughts Did He Just Tell His Wife On National Television that "I feel like you dont understand #Lego! Damn Cold Hearted," tweeted an angry fan.</p><p>"People like Sam feast on women's insecurities and silence. They see you not standing up for yourself and they double down," wrote an upset fan.</p><p>It has been noted that Sam and Jessica are not working as a team and their creation 'Cats and Dogs', and their lego masterpiece, despite getting praise from the judges was called "disjointed". Will they be the ones to go home in this episode?</p><p>'Lego Masters' airs on Wednesdays at 9 pm on Fox.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRopJWcvG65wKyrnqqjYsCmrdKopWZpXZq9qr%2FOnZxmal2orq55yZ6qrKGTlnqlu8Sspa1lpaOxpr7SrZinnF2hsqi7jKKlrJ2Tqr%2BmecKorKmklWKwsMHNrJyloZ6c</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
