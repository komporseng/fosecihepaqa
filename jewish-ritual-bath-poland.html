The new owner of a shuttered Polish strip club was in for a big shock when he found a mikveh, or Jewish ritual bath, in the basement of his new property.
A few years ago, Marian Zwolski, a businessman from Chmielnik in Poland, purchased the Sphinx, a nightclub that has been out of business for 15 years."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Relics of the club’s once thriving nightlife were still there — a Heineken sign on the wall, a pole in the middle of the room, a collection of ancient Egypt-themed decorations.</p><p>But the most interesting discovery happened when he opened the basement door.</p><p>In the basement was a historic, sacred Jewish bath, known as a mikveh. The baths are traditionally used for ritual purification — and the one in the basement of the Sphinx still had water in it.</p><p>What’s more, the original blue and white tiles and the Stars of David decorating the walls were still visible and in decent condition. In a neighboring room was a smaller mikveh, which was likely used by women.</p><p>“It’s astonishing,” said Meir Bulka, an advocate for the preservation of Jewish heritage in Poland, in an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>Haaretz</a>. “You enter the basement, and you’re in another world. It’s like a time capsule.”</p><p>Ritual purification is an important part of the Jewish faith and culture. Mikvehs are used to purify a person, granting them a spiritual rebirth before religious ceremonies or holidays.</p><p>They were also often used by women after menstruation, purifying them before they could resume marital relations with their husbands; this was more common in historical Judaism, but some conservative sects, such as Orthodox Judaism, still require this practice.</p><p>It’s unclear exactly how old the newly discovered mikveh is, but it’s likely it dates back to before World War II. Poland was a primary target for the Nazis leading up to the war. Before the Holocaust, Chmielnik had a population of around 10,000 — 80 percent of which was Jewish. After the war, the total number of Jewish people in Chmielnik was just four.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Ancient Origins</a>, Chmielnik was settled by Sephardic Jews fleeing the Spanish Inquisition in the 1630s. The Jewish community in Chmielnik built a synagogue there and thrived throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, significantly contributing the the town’s culture and economy over the years.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-450620 alt="Chmielnik Jewish Synagogue" width=610 height=448 data-sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/chmielnik-jewish-synagogue.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-450620 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>The Jewish Synagogue in Chmielnik is now a museum dedicated to those who lost their lives during the Holocaust.</span></p><p>But in 1939, the Nazis invaded Poland. On Sept. 5, they rounded up prominent Jewish figures in Chmielnik and herded them into a study hall, which they then set on fire. The remaining Jewish survivors were sentenced to forced labor in Chmielnik’s ghetto.</p><p>In 1942, the Nazis extinguished the ghetto, murdering hundreds of its Jewish residents and sending thousands more to the Treblinka death camp — the second-deadliest Nazi extermination camp after Auschwitz. Treblinka is estimated to have killed between 700,000 and 900,000 Jews, most of whom were Polish.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-450625 alt="Synagogue Holocaust Memorial" width=640 height=466 data-sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/synagogue-holocaust-memorial.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-450625 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>The Jewish synagogue in Chmielnik is now a museum and memorial to the Polish Jews killed in the Holocaust.</span></p><p>Now, Zwolski said he plans to turn the site into a museum or tourist attraction.</p><p>“I was born and raised here, so I care about the history of the place. I don’t want it to disappear,” Zwolski said. “I encourage the people to remember the past and I also call on you, the Jews, to preserve it and see to it that it is memorialized.”</p><p>After reading about the historic ritual bath found in Poland, see <a href=#>these disturbing photos from the Jewish ghettos during the Holocaust</a>.
