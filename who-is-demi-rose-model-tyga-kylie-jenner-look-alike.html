Demi loves the camera.</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Demi’s resemblance to Tyga’s ex is not the only thing she has in common with Kylie, as she loves having her photo taken. “Since I was a little girl, I always dreamed of becoming a model,” she wrote on her website. “I loved being in front of the camera and stroking a pose. Now, my dream is reality.” She and Kylie&nbsp;also both like to spend time with rappers, as Kylie is now dating&nbsp;hip-hop star, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>PARTYNEXTDOOR</strong></a>, 22.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>3. She was afraid she wasn’t tall enough to be a model.</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Demi is only 5’2, and this height disadvantage made her worried she wasn’t cut out for a life taking photos. However, she credits “the feedback I received from my growing fan base” for giving her the courage to try. “It still feels all new to me,” she said in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Eden Knows Implants</a>, “and I have great family and friends who have been supportive.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>[jwplatform SgwdEI0A]</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1" alt width=1 height=1 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-10><strong>4. She has a controversial past.</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Before Demi was stunning the people of Cannes with a plunging neckline, she was part of the group called Taz’s Angels, per the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>International Business Times</a>. They are a “group of Miami women that have gotten famous from their Instagram account,” per the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>official website</a>. However, it was long speculated that the Angels were supposedly escorts and Taz was their pimp. However, Demi left the group in 2015, right before the FBI reportedly investigated the group for prostitution, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Black Sports Online</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1" alt width=1 height=1 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-13><strong>5. She only got into the Instagram game because of a faker.</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Demi’s entire model career might not have happened if someone else wasn’t pretending to be her online. She started her Instagram&nbsp;account to “topple a fake user,” according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>FHM</a>. Right now, she has <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>2.2 million followers</a>, and her biggest fan is clearly Tyga.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>What do you think about Tyga and Demi spending time together, <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>?
