What does she do for a living? How old is Susan Toye?</p><p>Well, we cover it all below, so keep reading.</p><h3><strong>Meet Susan Toye, Sarma Melngailis Mom</strong></h3><p>Sarma Melngailis, once a renowned vegan restaurant owner in New York, named Pure Food and Wine until she met her ex-husband Anthony Strangis AKA Shane Fox. Then his elaborate scheme to dupe her out of millions of dollars eventually made her life and her business fall to pieces.</p><p>However, Sarma wasn’t the only one dragged into this. Her mom Susan Toye fell into Anthony’s trap and lost her money to him. According to the show, Sarma introduced Anthony to Susan during 2012 Thanksgiving. He utterly charmed her and they communicated with each other over email.</p><p>Not only that, but Susan also agreed to help out financially especially since she believed the money was for her daughter. Susan also believed that if she didn’t give her money Sarma probably would’ve had a nervous breakdown as she went through a rough phase of enduring abortion.</p><p>Anthony reportedly got $450 thousand that she had taken out of a trust which Anthony denied during the trial.</p><h3><strong>Is Susan Toye Still Married To Sarma Melngailis Dad?</strong></h3><p>No, Susan Toye isn’t married to Sarma Melngailis’s dad John. They divorced each other when Sarma was only 9 years old. However, despite their marriage didn’t work, both of them were abundantly involved in their daughters’ lives. Speaking of which, Sarma also has a sister named Ilza.</p><p>Susan then married her second husband Bob Jasse in 1981. Meanwhile, John reconnected with Michaele Weissman who he had initially met at a party in Cambridge back in the 1960s. They eventually got married and now share a son named Noah.</p><h3><strong>Susan Toye Husband</strong></h3><p>Coming to her husband, Susan married Bob Jasse and became Susan H Jasse. He was one of the innovative apple growers in New England.</p><p>Bob was also the owner of Chomerics, an electronics company outside Boston. They met each other when Susan got a job in Chomerics as a corporate cook. Not long after they got married, he sold the company, they combined a large family of grown children, and bought Alyson’s Apple Orchard in Walpole, N.H., as a retreat. The land overlooks the Connecticut River and the soil is unusually rich.</p><p>They lived in a restored 1830s home in Walpole, where they oversaw the harvests of their good soil, which also included a bustling lodging and events facility. Walpole is also home to documentary director Ken Burns and the summer home of “Little Women” author Louisa May Alcott.</p><p>Bob is said to have planted 2,000 dwarf apple trees and started a campaign of little or no spraying, producing heirlooms, and inviting visitors to visit the breathtakingly gorgeous farm. He encouraged everyone to come to the orchard, built a meeting and reunion house, and Susan cooked for dozens at their farmhouse table.</p><p>When Chefs Collaborative, a nonprofit that teaches customers about farmers, was just getting started, Bob was so gracious that he let them use his property rent-free. He didn’t hesitate, though, to instruct someone were to exit the train. At the same moment, he could be sending a check to someone else who needs some money. Susan was constantly close by, a soothing presence. She’ll keep running the orchard.</p><p>Sadly, Bob died on 2 November 2008. At the time of his death, he had six children.</p><h3><strong>Is Susan Toye On Facebook?</strong></h3><p>Yes, Susan Toye is on Facebook (<a href=#>@susan.jasse</a>) but she has private her account.</p><h3><strong>Susan Toye Age</strong></h3><p>As of 2022, Susan Toye is 77 years old.</p><h3><strong>Susan Toye Job</strong></h3><p>Susan Toye previously worked as a corporate cook.
