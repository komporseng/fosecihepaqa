It allows for the seamless substitution of underperforming starters with bench players who have more favorable circumstances.</p><h4 data-mce-fragment=1>Trading Assets</h4><p data-mce-fragment=1>In some cases, bench players can be leveraged as trade assets to improve the starting lineup. By curating a bench with valuable players, fantasy managers can enhance their bargaining power in trade negotiations.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The curation of a bench in fantasy football is a critical aspect of team management that should not be underestimated. The strategic selection of backup players can provide depth, flexibility, and insurance against unforeseen circumstances.
