Ezekiel Elliott - 6 Games</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Ezekiel Elliott, a star running back for the Dallas Cowboys, received a six-game suspension in 2017 for violating the league's personal conduct policy.

Adrian Peterson - 6 Games</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Adrian Peterson, one of the most accomplished running backs in NFL history, received a six-game suspension in 2014 for violating the league's personal conduct policy.
