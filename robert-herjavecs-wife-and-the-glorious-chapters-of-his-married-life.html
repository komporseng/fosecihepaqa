Best known as one of the five sharks in ABC's reality game show,<i> Shark Tank</i>, Herjavec's career, and his fascinating journey to glory aptly serve as the epitome of rags to riches. &nbsp;</p><p>The <i>Shark Tank</i> star escaped communism as a young kid in the former Yugoslavia and now thrives as a prominent businessman in North America. The Herjavec Group founder also keeps an appealing social life, prompting fans to take further interest in his personal life. &nbsp;</p><h2>Robert Herjavec is Married to Kym Johnson-Herjavec! &nbsp;</h2><p>You better believe it when we call Herjavec a man of many talents. Aside from being an illustrious business leader, author, and family man, the guy is also a fun entertainment personality. He has been married to <strong>Kym Johnson-Herjavec</strong> since 2016, which is relatively new, but the couple's tale of love is like no other. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/12/24/329066329_1229258431307777_7691512893673386388_n%20(1)-1703444031526.jpg><p>Herjavec kicked off his television career with CBS's Dragons' Den in 2006, later starring in <i>Shark's Tank</i>, and 2015, Robert took the endeavor to whole a new level when he joined <i>Dancing with the Stars</i>, where he met Johnson, who is an Australian professional ballroom dancer. &nbsp;</p><p>The season 20 of the dance competition series saw Herjavec and Kym dancing to their hearts' delight, but little did the audience know that romance was steadily erupting between the contestant, and the pro all while they showcased a relationship that seemed strictly professional. &nbsp;</p><p>Herjavec was married to his first wife at the time, which conveniently excluded the probability of romance between him and Kym. But things moved pretty fast for the two after they got eliminated from the show in 6th place. The two announced their engagement in February 2016 and got hitched in the summer. &nbsp;</p><h2>Get to Know Robert Herjavec's Gorgeous Wife, Kym Johnson! &nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>Best known as Herjavec's former<i> Dancing with the Stars</i> partner and now his doting wife, Kym Johnson has achieved more in life than just landing a multi-millionaire husband. The Australian dancer boasts an expansive television credit, having starred in <i>Australian Celebrity Survivor, Celebrity Apprentice</i>, and more. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/12/24/365572014_18376537807034282_7290268549170764378_n%20(1)-1703444039135.jpg><p>Kym's breakthrough in her dancing career came when she boarded the DWS season 3 in 2006. Starting off the exciting venture with Jerry Springer, Kym was paired with stars like Jaleel White, David Hasselhoff, and Mark Cuban in the following seasons. &nbsp;</p><p>Just as she delved into a romantic relationship with Robert, Kym also launched her fitness career by releasing a curated workout series — a 5678 Fitness DVD and companion diet book. She was briefly engaged to Australian cricket player <strong>Shane Watson.&nbsp;</strong></p><h3>Here's What We Know About Robert Herjavec's First Marriage!&nbsp;</h3><p>Not only was Robert married to his first wife, <strong>Dr. </strong><a href=#><strong>Diane Plese</strong></a>, an optometrist, but he allegedly also had a mistress by the name of <strong>Danielle Vasinova</strong>. While most believe Robert's marriage with Plese had already went down the hill by the time he fell in love with Kym, a section blames Johnson for wrecking Robert's first marriage. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/12/24/380382073_2588052111352824_2041393382500116700_n%20(1)-1703444045824.jpg><p>The self-made millionaire married Diane, who is also a Croatian immigrant when he was only 26. Herjavec was actively cementing his business empire when the two tied the knot in 1990. During their 24-year-long marriage, the pair welcomed two daughters and one son. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Although not much is known about Herjavec's blissful years with Plese, their unraveling marriage has been a widely covered subject of Robert's life. The <i>Shark's Tank</i> fame spoke at length about his failed marriage with Plese. &nbsp;</p><p>In his exclusive People interview, Robert shared the dark phase of his life when he contemplated suicide. "I just wanted to end it," said the tech mogul, <a href=#>adding</a>, "We were great parents and a great team, but over time we drifted apart." Robert and Diane finalized their divorce in 2016, with the mogul paying his ex-wife a whopping <i>$25 million</i> in settlement. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Robert Herjavec is a Doting Father of Five! &nbsp;</h3><p>Herjavec has fathered five kids throughout his two marriages, and the tech mogul is just as forthright when it comes to showcasing his love for his kids. The <i>Shark's Tank</i> star shares three kids, <a href=#><strong>Caprice</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Skye</strong></a>, and <a href=#>Brendan</a>, with his ex-wife. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/12/24/317009477_1569065950201913_9105646644330728279_n%20(1)-1703444052315.jpg><p>Robert's oldest, Brendan, is a budding name in the business, and the marketing industry. Brendan's strong stance on mental health education is evident as he works as a client manager for Inkblot Therapy, and also as an advisor for Memoryz. Brendan is married to the love of his life,<strong> Jessica Herjavec</strong>. &nbsp;</p><p>Robert's second of the brood, Skye, boasts an impressive educational background. According to sources, the USC graduate is quietly following in her father's footsteps. Herjavec's third kid from his first marriage, Caprice, is perhaps the best-known of the three. &nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Caprice</a> currently works as a consultant for Frederic W. Cook & Co. and previously dabbled in journalism. After receiving her degree from Columbia University, Caprice worked as a journalist for the Columbia Daily Spectator and also tried her hands at rowing. &nbsp;</p><p>Robert welcomed his youngest kids, twins <strong>Hudson</strong> and <a href=#>Haven</a>, with Johnson, on April 23, 2018. The doting father's happiness knew no bounds while announcing the birth of his kids. "May you always know love, peace, and grace in your lives. May your dreams have no bounds and your spirit be strong," Robert wrote alongside a cute snap of his then-newborns.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqumm52iqXqpsdGjmK%2Bdk6h6uLXFnmSappRiwamxjKCjqKqZpMK0ecKhmKmslafAbrvFZp%2Biq12irrO%2ByJ6bZqSZm7I%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
