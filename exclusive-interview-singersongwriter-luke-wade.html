It has not only helped people find happiness but for some people, music has contributed to&nbsp;the&nbsp;formation&nbsp;of their identity. Luke Wade is one such person.</p><p>While you might remember him from&nbsp;The Voice, the singer’s journey started way before he came on the show. It proved&nbsp;to be a great platform for him to showcase his talent. However, with more than 10 years of experience as a musician, the singer does not want to be just remembered as the show’s participant.</p><p>After two years of hard work, the singer is releasing his new album <strong>“Only Ghosts”</strong>. The album is set to release on January 13th. We got a chance to interact with him. Here is the detailed interview:</p><p><strong>Luke, you’ve been singing and performing for quite a long time. We would love to know about your musical journey.</strong></p><p>Well, I would love to tell you! It’s been amazing. This journey has been the single most impactful thing on the person I’ve become. I became a musician accidentally. I had an eye injury that left me blind in one eye and a severe heatstroke that left me a little slower than I was before, and as a young person with an underdeveloped sense of identity, I had a difficult time seeing that what made me different…made me special. Writing became my outlet and my expression, and the writing turned into music.</p><p>At first, I thought I would make a music statement, and move on to be a lawyer or&nbsp; engineer, but I spent so much time and energy on my music, that everything else kind of faded into the background. Since then, I have had a few bands, an unbelievable amount of fun and too many ups and downs to count.</p><p><strong>The description on your website says that you started singing to impress girls but then found your soul in it. How important is music to you?</strong></p><p>Music is my life. It’s the lens I use to see the world. If I learn something about life, about who I am, or who I want to be, it always comes out in my music. The way lyrics, melodies, and tone&nbsp;come together to make people feel is like nothing else.</p><p><strong>While your fans know about your musical influences when it comes to singing, we would like to know some of the songwriters you follow or admire?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I am such a super-fan of so many writers, so it’s hard to narrow it down. I love the process and that it’s so different for so many people. Ryan Adams, Ray Montagne, Eddie Vedder, and John Mayer were always early favorites. On the more modern side, I love Taylor Goldsmith of Dawes, Jason Isbell, Borns, and so much more. Probably my largest influence is Jay Buchanan. Seeing him perform his songs was one of the single biggest turning points in my artistic journey. He’s best known for his band Rival Sons.</p><p><strong>Your third album “Only Ghosts” is going to release soon. You must be really excited. Please tell us something about the album.</strong></p><p>It’s my favorite so far. I’ve never been more excited to share something with my fans. I love my previous albums, but every time through the process I learn so much and it allows me to do things a little better and smarter than the time before. With this album, I was able to use what I’ve learned to be a little more patient, focus on the quality of the songs, the production, and I feel like my vision has really come together.</p><p><strong>Which songs are your favorites from the album?</strong></p><p>It’s hard to pick a favorite, but as an artist, I’ll always pick the more personal and intimate songs. I love&nbsp;“Say It Out Loud”, “Dreams for the sentiment”, but there isn’t a song on the album that I’m not incredibly proud of.</p><p><strong>Did you come up with the title “Only Ghosts”? What does the title signify?</strong></p><p>It comes from a line in “Kissing Makeup.” “Face to face with what you fear the most, I can show you that their only ghosts.” It’s about how the things we are afraid of are often just in our mind.</p><p><strong>You plan to do the first LIVE show in your hometown Texas. Why? Any particular reason?</strong></p><p>I love all of my fans regardless of where they live, but Fort Worth has given me so much and has been more supportive than I can even explain. It’s amazing to give back any way I can.</p><p><strong>On your website, while referring to Texas, you describe yourself as “a peculiar person in a peculiar place”. Please elaborate on that.</strong></p><p>It’s tough to answer this in a few sentences, but I can say that being the son of artists in a small rural town in Texas when you are an overthinking, hyperactive, and possibly eccentric young man has its challenges. Lucky for me it gave me the drive and material I need to start writing songs.</p><p><strong>You have been recognized by the City of Fort Worth for your charitable work with Cook Children’s Medical Center. When did you decide to take up this cause?&nbsp; Tell us more about it.</strong></p><p>As a child, I spent a lot of my time in and out of hospitals. I had spinal meningitis as an&nbsp; infant, an eye injury as a teenager, and then a heat stroke a few years later. I guess I understand what it’s&nbsp; like to be a child in a hospital. When you’re that young it’s hard not to feel like your identity becomes the thing….the ailment, and I think that doesn’t have to be the way that it is. Music can help distract kids, but it can also help to give them an identity.</p><p><strong>Many people might have asked you about your journey on The Voice but we would like to know your journey after the show. How do you want people to remember Luke Wade?</strong></p><p>I want people to remember me for the way I connected with them most, whatever that might have been. If it was the show, that’s fine, but selfishly, I hope it’s&nbsp; going to be something I will do or have done after the show.</p><p>The album is set to release on January 13th, 2017. Luke Wade will be performing his first LIVE show in Texas. For more information, click&nbsp;<a href=#>here</a>.</p><p>Are you excited for the new album?
