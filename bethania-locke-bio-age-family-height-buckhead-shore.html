The cast of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Buckhead Shore</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> was living their dream. However, unlike its original franchise, the 9 longtime friends chronicled “Lake Life” in Atlanta’s upscale Buckhead, Georgia. Yes, lake life! The “Shore” part of the title didn’t actually refer to an ocean. It was just put there to let the viewers know that this was another show in the </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Jersey Shore</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> franchise.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“Secrets out! 🥳 We’re turning up for one unforgettable night with the premiere of #BuckheadShore Thursday, June 23rd at 9/8c on @MTV! @buckheadshore,” Bethania shared her excitement for the premiere v.i.a IG.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Joining Bethania for this inaugural season were his co-stars JuJu Barney, Katie Canham, Savannah Gabriel, Parker Lipman, Chelsea Prescott, Adamo Giraldo, Pat Muresan, and DJ Simmons. Each one with a different persona — which definitely called for a lot of drama!</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, what happened in Lake House remained in the Lake House. Despite all the dramas, the cast remained even friends after the show.&nbsp; “We’re family, and we know each other. We’re not put together, we grew up together, some of us, but we all are friends,” Bethania’s hook-up partner/co-star Simmons explained.</span></p><p><i><span style=font-weight:400>Buckhead Shore</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> premiered on June 23, 2022.</span></p><h3><b>Bethania Locke Boyfriend</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Bethania Locke hadn’t revealed her boyfriend at the time of writing this article. Well, given that </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Buckhead Shore</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> was still going on, it would only make sense for her not to hand out the spoilers.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The last we checked, she was still eager to fully venture into the world of dating. But stumbling upon her longtime friend/a recent hook-up, DJ Simmons on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Buckhead Shore</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, Bethania was having a tough time looking forward.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, it wasn’t long before she appeared on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Buckhead Shore</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> that she’d lost her virginity.
