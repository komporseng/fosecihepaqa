DailyMailThe jawbone found by researchers suggests pandas originated in Europe 
Though it’s China’s official national animal, the giant panda may have actually originated in Eastern Europe.
A team of researchers has discovered a 10-million-year-old jawbone of an ancient mammal while on an archeological dig site in northern Hungary.
Based on the shape, size, and structure of the teeth, they believe that the jawbone belongs to the ancestor to the modern day giant panda, which was previously believed to be confined to China."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Studying those migration patterns could help researchers uncover the way that pandas might have found their way there as well.</p><p>Though researchers can not definitively say which came first — Europe or Asia — there is evidence that suggests that pandas originated in Europe.</p><p>The chemical makeup of the area where the jawbone was found indicates that the area used to be a lush subtropical forest, near to a lake, the perfect climate for a giant panda. However, about five million years ago, the climate shifted.</p><p>“The environment cooled and dried out,” says Louis de Bonis, a researcher at the University of Poitiers in France. “There was a change in the faunas in Europe, and the species linked to dense warm forest disappeared.”</p><p>China was most likely the closest and most accommodating climate for the pandas to travel to. Currently, the giant panda lives only in the western forested mountain ranges of China.</p><p>Next, check out these <a href=#>amazing panda facts</a>.
