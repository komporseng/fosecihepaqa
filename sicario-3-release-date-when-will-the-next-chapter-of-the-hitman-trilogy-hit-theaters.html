Since we worked with Taylor Sheridan, who wrote the last two movies, we always thought this would be at least a three-part project. That means filming should start in 2024, and a 2025 release date seems likely after that. Still, there has been no official word yet, and Sicario 3 might not come out until 2026 if things take a little longer than planned.</p><h2 id=who-will-be-in-sicario-3>Who Will be in Sicario 3?</h2><p><strong>Fans can expect Josh Brolin to play Matt Graver again and Benicio del Toro to play Alejandro Gillick.
