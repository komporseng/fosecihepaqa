He was born in Split, Croatia, a beach city on the Adriatic Sea.</p><p>He is one of three children born to Bosko Rebic and Nedilijka. Rebic’s adolescence was challenging since his parents battled to support three children while earning a little. Rebic started his sporting career as a youth with Vinjani. Simultaneously, he spent six years honing and developing his skills while playing for the club.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Ante-Rebic-1-1.jpg alt width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Ante Rebić Height, Weight</h2><p><strong>Rebi</strong> is 1.85 m (6 ft 1 in) tall, which is exceptionally tall for a winger. Furthermore, he weighs 78 kg (172 lbs). Because of this, he is highly nimble and quick on his feet. It was displayed at the 2018 World Cup in Russia when Rebi and Cristiano Ronaldo recorded 34km/hr.</p><h2>Career</h2><ul><li>Despite the fact that Ante started playing football at an early age, he was never genuinely considered a player of the top class, unlike now. Rebic made his professional debut with RNK Split, with mixed results.</li><li>The attacker made his breakthrough when he joined for Italian powerhouse Fiorentina for an estimated €4.50 million during the 2013-2014 season.</li><li>The Croatian footballer was a member of the squad for three seasons. In the summer of 2016, the Fiorentina youngster shifted his loan to Eintracht Frankfurt, where he made a name for himself.</li><li>The fast winger made his Eintracht debut on October 17, 2016, against Bayer Leverkusen. Ante would eventually assist Marco Fabian in scoring the game-winning goal, as he had before.</li><li>Rebic scored his first club goal in a 2-0 win against SV Darmstadt 98. The Frankfurt striker would ultimately play 100 times for the club, scoring 25 goals.</li><li>Similarly, his impressive performances earned him a place on the 25-man team for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.</li><li>Following Ante’s impressive performances at the 2018 FIFA World Cup and for Eintracht Frankfurt in the same season, Rebic gained a move to Italian powerhouse AC Milan, where he is now playing.</li><li>Ante made his senior debut for Croatia against Liechtenstein in a friendly match on July 31, 2013. In his debut, the striker would eventually score the game-winning goal.</li><li>After an auspicious start, the striker had many highs and lows, but starting in the FIFA World Cup final has to rank as the top of his international career.</li><li>Rebic also played an important role in his team’s triumph in reaching their first World Cup final, which they lost to France.</li><li>As a result, the Frankfurt attacker played in all six games and scored one goal. Most importantly, he scored the first goal against an Argentina team captained by Lionel Messi.</li><li>Croatia outperformed everyone’s expectations at the 2018 World Cup, defeating strong opposition on way to the final game.</li><li>Rebic was instrumental in their most shocking victory, which came against a strong English club.</li></ul><h2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Ante-Rebic-2-1.jpg alt width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h2><h2>Ante Rebić’s Net Worth</h2><p>He is now paid €3.5 million per year by AC Milan. Ante Rebic’s salary at Fiorentina was far lower than this sum. It should be mentioned that he is one of AC Milan’s highest-paid players. Ante Rebic’s net worth is estimated to be about €3 million as of August 2023. He amassed his €3 million wealth while playing for AC Milan, Eintracht Frankfurt, Fiorentina, and the Croatia national football team.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Ante-Rebic-3-1.jpeg alt width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>Brand Endorsement</h2><p>Nike, the American sportswear giant, sponsors the deft winger with clothing and football gear. The true value of the endorsement is unclear.</p><p>During games, Rebic regularly wears Nike-branded clothing and participates in infrequent club and national team advertising.</p><h2>Property And Cars</h2><p>He is only concerned with his football career and does not discuss his personal life in public. His current address is unknown.</p><p>Ante drives a $69,950 Mercedes-Benz GT-Class. The Croatian international, on the other hand, is as sensitive and courteous off the field as the winger is lethal on it.</p><h2>Ante Rebić Girlfriend, Dating</h2><p>He is unmarried, and his Instagram account shows that he routinely publishes images of himself with different ladies and friends at various events and locales. His connection, on the other hand, has yet to be proven. He seems to be preoccupied with his football career and is uninterested in revealing his personal life to the public.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Ante-Rebic-4-1.jpg alt width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>Awards & Achievement</h2><ul><li>In 2018, Croatian Hope of the Year 2013</li><li>Order of Duke Branimir with Ribbon</li><li>In the 2017-18 season, DFB Pokal</li><li>2018 FIFA World Cup Runner-Up</li></ul><h2>Interesting Facts</h2><ul><li>In the 2011/2012 season, he appeared in 20 games and scored five league goals. The next season, he made 29 appearances and scored eleven goals.</li><li>On August 3, 2014, he agreed to a one-season loan with German Leipzig.</li><li>He’s also noted for his long-distance passing, crossing, and shooting precision.
