With his enormous net worth and successful profession, he reportedly earns much more than the $53,475 per year average income of a news presenter in Spain.</p><p>The Informe 79 presenter had such a huge bank account that he never had to worry about money. On October 17, 2014, Univision Puerto Rico abruptly canceled his program Las Noticias, which caused him a number of problems in the past. He previously spent nine years on Telemundo working with seasoned broadcaster Anibal Gonzalez Irizarry. Additionally, he returned to Tele-Once in 1986 and took over as the host of “Las Noticias.”</p><p>YOU&nbsp; MAY ALSO LIKE: <a href=# rel=bookmark>Josh Croup</a></p><h2>Early Life’s Low Profile of Ramon Enrique Torres</h2><p>He to maintain a low profile with regard to his early life and origins.

The Puerto Rican TV reporter never provided any details about his ex- or current wives or girlfriends. Regrettably, there is no proof to indicate whether he is married or not. The fact that he has a son named Xavier Enrique Torres and a daughter named Layza Torres does indicate that he has had an affair in the past.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/elvocero-1.jpg><p>Layza Torres, Ramon’s daughter, followed in her father’s footsteps and became a journalist as well.

Despite taking a break in 2014, the veteran made a comeback to television in 2019 to co-star in Informe 79 on WTCV alongside her daughter.</p><p>His son took a another route, while her daughter walked after him. Despite working in front of the cameras, his work was acting rather than journalism. He appeared in an interesting number of movies, including “Break-In,” “Entourage,” and “Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6XCra3Rp5ytr5%2Bnwal6wqikaKqRoryvecSnqaKppZp6tbvRq5ysZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
